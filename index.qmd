Hi, I am Sampada! I am a rising senior at Brandeis University, double majoring in Computer Science and Business. I am someone who loves to learn and enjoys being challenged! In the middle of my undergraduate journey, I discovered my love for technology and have been learning new and more technical skills every since.  

I believe there is always more to learn. That is one of the reasons why I do not say no to anything. I try to take advantage of every opportunity in my way and expand my knowledge on different topics. Through my strong technical skills and willingness to learn, I aspire to continue working in the biotechnology industry and contribute to helping finding cures for illnesses and conditions.
